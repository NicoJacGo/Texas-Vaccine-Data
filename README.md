# **Texas COVID Vaccine Data** 
---
This dataset was created to give users the ability to examine Texas' COVID vaccine allotment progress, which is an ongoing process. The data will be updated on a weekly basis, and aggregated in the *aggregate.csv* file. Data is aggregated from data published by the Texas DSHS --[DSHS' website with weekly vaccine allocation reports](https://www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus/immunize/vaccine.aspx). The raw data, published in .pdf format, is available from the raw folder. 

**NOTE**: new data is provided once weekly, on Tuesday, by the Texas DSHS and converted from pdf to csv. 

## Data File Descriptions

## Intended Uses

We intend on making this web application available to the general populace, giving them the ability to easily locate the nearest location offering vaccines, with the given weekly vaccine allotment and previous weekly data, along with aggregate weekly allotment data.

If possible, data regarding the number of vaccinated individuals will be subtracted from the weekly allotment data, giving users a more accurate view of the current number of available doses at a given location. 

Additional information will include analysis-related information such as (1) vaccinated individuals per capita, (2) number of *fully* vaccinated individuals (two doses), and (3) aggregate data.
